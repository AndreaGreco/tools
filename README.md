Some little tools I make for my system

# Tools list
## DUG
Dug is a pseudographical du interface

## HEXD
It's another hex dumper (written in Python) with some features that I needed.
It can dump just hex digits (no ASCII translation), change line width (i.e. 93 bytes), suppress address and so on.
It is not supposed to be Ultimate Hex Dumper, but just an extensible hex dumper with the features I need time by time.

## More to come
